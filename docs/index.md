## Reason
I'm self taught developer. I code in Javascript, Typescript, Python and Java.

I want to scale myself, to be more productive, to be less error-prone, to move faster.

__But I'm kinda stuck.__

Every programming task or project feels like I'm doing this for the first time.

I see the root-cause for this is in a lot of details and a lot of options exist to
solve the programming problem. All this information is almost impossible to 
memorize and follow.

Yet, the my programming tasks are basically the same every time. But every time
I tend to do them in 'another way', from scratch.

__So I decided to stop it.__

This repo is not just a collection of receipts.

This is true end to end opinionated collection of rules and templates to build
__any__ new project.

### Here are couple of decisions, that I take now:
1. I choose __Java__ as my main programming language for backend.
I do it mainly because among all other languages I studied, Java offers a lot of tools,
that ease Object-Oriented design and allow to write Clean Code.
And performance of Java code is much better, than other languages I studied.
2. I choose __Spring framework__ as my main library.
I do it because Spring offers set of tools that solve main programming tasks.
3. I choose __Gradle__ as my dependency management system.
I do it just because one dependency with Maven takes much more time to read through.
4. I choose __IntelliJ IDEA__ as my IDE.

I promise myself to follow these rules and use these templates in all my projects
from now on.
